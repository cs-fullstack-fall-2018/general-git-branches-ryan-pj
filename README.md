# Assignment on using branches in Git

1. Check status of your local repository

2. Create a new branch with your name as part of the branch name (e.g. branch-kevin)

3. Switch to the newly added branch

4. Edit the README file and at the bottom a 'WAS HERE' message using your name (e.g. KEVIN WAS HERE!)

5. Use ```git diff``` to compare the versions (note how differences are displayed)

6. Commit and push your changes to the local branch you created

7. Switch back to master branch using checkout and use ```git branched --merged``` to view branch merge status

8. Merge in your branch

9. Push your merged changes to the remote repository's master branch
